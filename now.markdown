# What am I doing now?

&nbsp;

I am trying to be the best and most present dad that I can be to Maya (4) and Tom (almost 2).

Working remotely and building tools for design systems at [Interplay](http://interplayapp.com).

A founding fellow of the [On Deck Design](https://www.beondeck.com/design) fellowship.

Planning our second renovation on a 1980s bungalow we just bought in a small village in Co. Armagh, Northern Ireland. Here's our [first renovation](https://www.instagram.com/guinearow/).

Helping my wife set up a cut flower farm business called [Reaper & Sow](https://www.instagram.com/reaperandsow/) in our garden.

My current obsession (escape?) is mechanical keyboards. I'm currently using an Ortholinear Candybar as my daily driver.

I'm also trying to pour acceptable latte art after 9 years since I worked behind the bar at [3fe](http://3fe.com).
