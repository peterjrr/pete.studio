## What am I doing now?

Building tools for design systems at [Interplay](http://interplayapp.com).

A founding fellow of the [On Deck Design](https://www.beondeck.com/design) fellowship.

Being the most present dad that I can be to Maya (4) and Tom (almost 2).

Planning our second renovation. This time on a 1980s bungalow we just bought before Christmas in a small village in Co. Armagh, Northern Ireland. Here's our [first renovation](https://www.instagram.com/guinearow/).

Helping my wife set up a cut flower farm business called [Reaper & Sow](https://www.instagram.com/reaperandsow/) in our garden.

My current silly obsession is mechanical keyboards. I'm currently using a lavender Ortholinear Candybar as my daily driver which I love.

It's 9 years since I worked behind the bar at [3fe](http://3fe.com) and I am trying to pour acceptable latte art on my new espresso machine. I definitely wouldn't get hired now!
