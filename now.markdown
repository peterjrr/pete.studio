What am I doing now?

Planning our second renovation on a new house we just bought in a small village in Co. Armagh, Northern Ireland. Here's our [first renovation](https://www.instagram.com/guinearow/).

Helping my wife set up a cut flower farm business called [Reaper & Sow](https://www.instagram.com/reaperandsow/) in our garden.

Focused on being the best and most present dad that I can be to Maya (4) and Tom (almost 2).

Working remotely and building tools for design systems at Interplay.

A founding fellow of the On Deck Designer fellowship.
