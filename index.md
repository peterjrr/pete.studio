Hi, I'm Pete! I'm a product designer based in Northern Ireland. I am a founding designer at [Interplay](https://interplayapp.com).

At Interplay we're working to close the gap between design and engineering by automating the repetitive work thatâ€™s required to translate design to code and back again. We're helping designers get closer to production code without writing code and building for a future where designers can own the entire process from concept to production. If you're working with design systems drop me a message and I'd love to show you what we're building.

I'm a founding fellow of the [On Deck Designers Fellowship](https://www.beondeck.com/designers) which is an eight-week remote program for ambitious designers who want to hone their skills, increase their impact and grow as leaders. 

Before joining Interplay I freelanced for 7 years and worked remotely all over Europe. I work a 4 day week and I would recommend it. I generally get completely obsessed about whatever I'm interested in which currently includes mechanical keyboards, gardening, investing, gentle parenting, co-housing projects, writing and coffee. 

If you'd like to get in touch you can [drop me an email](mailto:hi@pete.studio?Subject=Hi), [find me on twitter](https://twitter.com/petermcdonagh_) or [connect on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterjrr/).
